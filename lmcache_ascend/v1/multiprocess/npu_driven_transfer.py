"""LMCache-driven KV cache transfer operations for the MPCacheServer (NPU).

Port of upstream ``lmcache/v1/multiprocess/modules/lmcache_driven_transfer.py``
(the transfer-function half; the server-side ``LMCacheDrivenTransferModule``
request handlers are not ported -- ``server.py``'s :class:`NPUCacheContext`
calls :func:`transfer_kv_per_object_group` directly, per the MP-mode design
doc).

Deliberate deltas from upstream (everything else ports verbatim):

* ``lmc_ops`` resolves to ``lmcache_ascend.c_ops`` directly instead of
  ``lmcache.c_ops``. The Ascend plugin swaps ``sys.modules["lmcache.c_ops"]``
  in ``_patch_ops`` *after* some modules have already bound the pre-swap
  module object; importing the Ascend extension by its own name is immune to
  that ordering.
* ``_HAS_NATIVE_OBJECT_GROUP_TRANSFER`` keeps upstream's identity check
  against ``python_ops_fallback``: the plugin's ``_patch_ops`` merges the
  fallback symbols into the Ascend ``c_ops`` when the extension lacks them
  (the fallback ``execute_object_group_transfer`` always raises), so a bare
  ``hasattr`` probe would mis-route to the fast path.
* :func:`lmcache_memcpy_async_h2d` / :func:`lmcache_memcpy_async_d2h` /
  :func:`build_staging_copies` are ported in-place from upstream
  ``lmcache/v1/gpu_connector/gpu_ops.py`` with the GDS branch dropped (no
  GPUDirect Storage on NPU). Function and parameter names are kept identical
  so the fallback path stays diff-auditable against upstream.

The fast path (:func:`_run_object_group_transfer_plan`) resolves every
staging copy and kernel launch to plain pointers/scalars in Python and hands
the whole plan to ``execute_object_group_transfer``, which issues it within a
single GIL release (same contract as upstream).

    """Helper function to transfer memory objects of a single object group
    to/from GPU, with batching support.

    Args:
        cache_context: The GPU cache context containing the KV cache information.
        block_ids_gpu: GPU block IDs to retrieve into, indexed by LMCache KV group
            index. It should satisfy `len(block_ids_gpu[i]) == len(memory_objs) *
            blocks_per_chunk[i]` for each group `i`.
            Note that the block IDs list are already on GPU.
        memory_objs: The list of MemoryObj instances to copy from. It could be
            None when allocation or retrieval fails. For store (D2H), it should
            ignore the None entry and continue copying the rest. For retrieve
            (H2D), it should raise the error and stop copying.
        object_group_id: Index of the object group being copied.
        batch_size: The number of memory objects to perform batched copy
        skip_first_n_tokens: Number of tokens to skip writing at the start of
            the retrieve range. This avoids overwriting APC-shared GPU blocks that
            may be read concurrently by other requests.
        direction: The transfer direction, H2D (retrieve) or D2H (store).

    Raises:
        ValueError: If it founds None entry in memory_objs when direction is H2D.
    Note:
        This function expects the caller to stage the block ids (list[list[int]])
        into GPU tensors and pass them in as `block_ids_gpu`.
